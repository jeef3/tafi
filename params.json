{"name":"Tafi","tagline":"The advanced formatted input.","body":"### What is Tafi?\r\n\r\nSilly name really, but I have no idea what else to call this thing. It is basically an advanced formatted input. It allows you to restrict input to that which follows a structured format, selecting only from a list of known options. Perhaps where each option you select, decides a different path of available options for the rest of the input.\r\n\r\n### Could you show me an example?\r\n\r\nPerhaps take phone numbers as an example. If you were to start typing a phone number, there is a [finite list of country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes) to choose from. Let's call up New Zealand: `+64`.\r\n\r\nWith `+64` set as our country code, we know that the next part of the number must come from one of New Zealands [subscriber toll dialling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_New_Zealand#Subscriber_toll_dialling_.28the_historic_codes.29) options.\r\n\r\nIf you had dialled up `+1` for The United States, then there would be a completely different [list of options to choose from](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_the_United_States#Current_system).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThought that was complex? What till you see how to use this thing.","google":"UA-40369410-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
